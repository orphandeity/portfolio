      <p>
        Hi there! I&apos;m Jeff. I&apos;m an electronic musician who loves
        building things with code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first discovered programming through computer music. For over ten
        years, I&apos;ve used visual programming languages like Max and Pure
        Data to make custom instruments and audio effects. Learning to use these
        tools was a challenging but rewarding experience that helped me grow as
        an artist. They taught me to approach problem-solving programmatically
        and inspired me to explore innovative ways to combine different mediums
        and technologies.

        Several years ago, I shifted my focus toward web technologies. I found
        myself intrigued by hypermedia and was eager to experiment with the
        platform&apos;s capabilities. I started learning about HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript and gradually built my skills in web development. It
        wasn&apos;t easy initially, but I enjoyed creating websites and
        applications that people could access worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, I&apos;ve been honing my skills and learning JavaScript. I
        recently completed the Frontend Engineering Career Path certification
        program at Codecademy and participated in a comprehensive series of
        React workshops from Frontend Masters. I am always working on personal
        projects to refine my skills and am determined to stay current within a
        quickly changing industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m seeking a full-time role where I can help a company achieve its
        goals and grow as a crucial team member.
